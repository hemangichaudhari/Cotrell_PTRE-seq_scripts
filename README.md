Scripts used in Cottrell et al, 2017 manuscript
Steps and Scripts
1. Library design
2. Raw sequencing data to Barcode counts
All replicates were indexed with a different P1 index and pooled and sequenced. FastQ files were first demultiplexed, and then counts were obtained per barcode. Script: KC_barcode_counts.sh
3. Preliminary analysis: Counts to RNA expression and TE efficiency
4. Linear Modeling to RNA expression and TE efficiency Script: modeling_FOLD.R
